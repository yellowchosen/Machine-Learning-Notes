# 1. Supervised learning
We have two typical types(learning models). Regression and Classification.

| Regression  | Classification |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Predict a number  | Predict categories  |
| Infinitely many possible outputs | Small number of possible outputs  |
|House price prediction | Breast cancer or Spam emails(0/1) |



# 2ã€‚ Unsupervised learning
we focused on Clustering and Non-clustering problems. The special features of Unsupervised learning are unlabeled data in training dataset, and we will not give the correct outputs and never know the outputs in advanced. Just analyzing by using the Unsupervised learning algorithm and then get the "results"(outputs).

Some applications of clustering in Unsupervised learning: Google news, DNA microarray, Astronomical Data Analysis and Social media.
The explaination of google news is that the tons of news will be collected in google website backend, then the system/algorithm divided them by many different groups, each group represented a specific news topic(which called **clustering**).

The definition of Unsupervised learning: Data only comes with inouts X, but not output lebels Y. Algorithm has to find **stucture** in the data.

| Clustering  | Dimensionality reduction |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Group similar data points together | Compress data using fewer numbers |
