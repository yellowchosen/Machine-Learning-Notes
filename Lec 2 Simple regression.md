By giving a certain house size(suqare feet) to predict price($) of this house. Such like: **y=kx+b**
Notation: <br />
          *x* = "input" variable feature,<br />
          *y* = "output" variable , "target" variable,<br />
          *m* = number of training examples,<br />
          *(x, y)* = single training example,<br />
          ($x^i$, $y^i$) = $i^{th}$ training example ($1^{st}$, $2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}$, ...)<br />
