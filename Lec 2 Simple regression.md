# 1. Simple regression model
Very classic simple regression model, which is **house price prediction** :

By giving a certain house size(suqare feet) to predict price($) of this house.
Notation: <br />
          *x* = "input" variable feature,<br />
          *y* = "output" variable , "target" variable,<br />
          *m* = number of training examples,<br />
          *(x, y)* = single training example,<br />
          ($x^i$, $y^i$) = $i^{th}$ training example ($1^{st}$, $2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}$, ...)<br />

*f* represents function <br />
*y-hat* represents estimated y <br />
Suppose input x(size) into function, and then predict output y(price). This is a mapping fucntion **X -> Y**.

Linear Function(model): $f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b$ , (Univariate) Linear regression with **one** variable.
